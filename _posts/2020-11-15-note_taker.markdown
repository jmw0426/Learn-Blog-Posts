I know, I know. You're asking what kind of a name is Note Taker? I have one simple answer for you: easy to remember. That's the entire premise of this application! 

Do you ever forget things and wish that you had written them down? With Note Taker the only things that you have to remember are your username and password. Note Taker is a simple and easy to use web application that enables you to make, edit, and delete notes on the fly. 

Built with ActiveRecord, Sinatra, Bootstrap, and Ruby, Note Taker dynamically creates urls for each individual note and allows you to manage them independent of each other. Hinged on user sessions and secure password encryption, Note Taker allows you to keep your information private and secure. This application was made with UI as it's top priority in order to accomodate even the most forgetful people out there. 

***Quick***, clone this repository https://github.com/jmw0426/note_taker and follow the instructions in the README before you forget!
