I am an Army veteran with a background in Human Resources, Sales, Management, and Politics, and I am tired of it all. The deception, backstabbing, and disloyalty are not only tiresome, but also demotivating and dehumanizing. I began asking myself, "Why am I here?" The only answer that I could find was that it was all that I had tried. 

Several years ago I began exposing myself to the inner workings of computers. I was fascinated by the intricacies of the components and rapid advancements in technology. The more questions I asked, the more volcanic excitement built up in me. For the first time in a long time I was impassioned to learn. Then I found it: the art of programming. A whole world of languages and culture to which I had never before been exposed.

I decided to make a change. I wanted something to show for my work that intrinsically expressed my creativity and my passion. And while I certainly have my own ideas for programs and applications, I resolved to make this my goal for a full time career. A career focused on development rather than image. 

I submitted my application and subsequently received a letter of acceptance. The day was won! I had surmounted the mountain of drudgery and crossed the finish line to my own perceived success. Then it hit me: life. The witches' brew of lack of focus, sick family members, quarantine, no routine, homeschooling, and mental health boiled away the dream of freedom and fidelity. 

Of course I was distraught; I felt that the volcano had erupted and I was left with nothing to show for my vigor. I didn't complete the First Mile in the Full Time Software Engineering course at FlatIron School. Hell, I didn't even finish my first blog post in the allotted time. Self loathing washed over me like acid rain. Why did I do this to myself and why does the world have to endlessly batter me with wave after wave of grief and hardship?

Forgiving myself was much easier said than done. Like wrestling honey away from a bear, I too had to rip away self-hatred from the insatiable beast of my mind that was hell-bent on gorging itself with my guilt and shame. I decided that I still wanted to complete this program, but things were going to have to change. I needed a routine to enforce discipline. I needed time to allow myself to recuperate my thoughts and relax my mind. I needed support; I can't white knuckle my way through life change. 

Most importantly, I needed a goal. In order to pierce my target, I must first have a sharp, pointed arrow. My lofty ideas, hopes, and dreams were going to stay stagnant unless I directed my gaze towards the object of my desire and viciously fought to obtain it. 

I decided that my goal was to master the MERN stack and use it to make my own social networking application. Even though this is my second attempt at rearranging my stars, change still doesn't come easily. I have started again with a renewed vigor, a focused attitude, and a willingness to adapt to the inevitable changes to come. There will be moments of clarity and passion, and moments of despair and confusion. Utilizing a structure, support, and patience is the only way that I can succeed. Therein lies the way to progress: one giant leap forward and three steps back.
